# TypeScript Error Fixes for Date Simulation Feature

This document describes the TypeScript errors encountered after implementing the wellness date simulation feature and the fixes applied.

## Error 1: Missing Required Arguments in `hasSubmittedWellnessToday` Function

### Error Message
```
ERROR in src/pages/Dashboard.tsx:339:38
TS2554: Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 0.
    337 |         if (user.packageType !== 'none' && !hasCheckedWellnessToday) {
    338 |           // Check if they've already submitted wellness data today
  > 339 |           const hasSubmitted = await hasSubmittedWellnessToday();
        |                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### Issue
When we updated the wellness service to support date simulation, we modified the `hasSubmittedWellnessToday` function signature to require a token parameter and an optional custom date:

```typescript
export const hasSubmittedWellnessToday = async (
  token: string,
  customDate?: Date
): Promise<boolean>
```

However, existing calls to this function in Dashboard.tsx were still using the old signature without passing any arguments.

### Fix
We updated the calls to pass the required token parameter:

```typescript
// Before
const hasSubmitted = await hasSubmittedWellnessToday();

// After
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
if (!token) return;

const hasSubmitted = await hasSubmittedWellnessToday(token);
```

This fix was applied to two locations in Dashboard.tsx (lines 339 and 366).

## Error 2: Return Type Mismatch in Wellness Submit Functions

### Error Message
```
ERROR in src/pages/Dashboard.tsx:1183:9
TS2322: Type '(ratings: WellnessRating[]) => Promise<boolean>' is not assignable to type '(ratings: WellnessRating[]) => Promise<void>'.
  Type 'Promise<boolean>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<void>'.
    Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'void'.
```

### Issue
The `handleWellnessSubmit` functions in both Dashboard.tsx and WellnessLogs.tsx were returning a boolean value:

```typescript
const handleWellnessSubmit = async (ratings: WellnessRating[]) => {
  // ...
  return true;
};
```

However, the `onSubmit` prop in DailyWellnessPopup expects a function that returns Promise<void>:

```typescript
interface DailyWellnessPopupProps {
  // ...
  onSubmit: (ratings: WellnessRating[]) => Promise<void>;
  // ...
}
```

### Fix
We modified both `handleWellnessSubmit` functions to explicitly return void by:
1. Adding a return type annotation: `Promise<void>`
2. Removing the `return true` statement

```typescript
// Before
const handleWellnessSubmit = async (ratings: WellnessRating[]) => {
  try {
    // ...
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
};

// After
const handleWellnessSubmit = async (ratings: WellnessRating[]): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    // ...
    // No return statement needed
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
};
```

This fix was applied to both Dashboard.tsx and WellnessLogs.tsx.

## Conclusion

The TypeScript errors were caused by two issues:

1. **Changed function signatures** in the wellness service that weren't updated in all consuming components
2. **Return type mismatches** between the component props and handler functions

These types of errors highlight the importance of updating all related code when modifying function signatures, especially in TypeScript projects where type checking helps ensure consistency across the codebase.

After applying these fixes, the date simulation feature now works correctly without TypeScript errors, allowing for effective testing of wellness tracking functionality across different dates.
